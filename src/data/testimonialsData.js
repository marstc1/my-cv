        "I've worked closely with Chris on a couple of things in the last month or so and it has been a real pleasure.  Two things stand out that I think are definitely worth rewarding.  The first is the extra effort Chris went to in producing an excellent info graphic documenting the history of Avivaâ€™s External Banking Partners. The second was how he led the creation of the team charter; his initial work formed the main content of the final deliverable.  For me, this work demonstrates Chris' alignment to our Care More value!"
